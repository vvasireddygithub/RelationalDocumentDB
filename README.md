# ReltionalDocumentDB

Working on MFT product, developing small DocumentDB like Mango - got an Idea why don't we impose Relational rules on this? like Normalization, foreign keys and Relations and schema on collections so collection will be strict type like Java Generics - you cannot add Dog object to Cat collection and Vice versa.
